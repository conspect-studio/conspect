//! # multiview-preview
//!
//! Preview taps (input / program / output) and the **isolation contract** for
//! Multiview's best-effort, read-only preview side-channel. The library target is
//! `multiview_preview`.
//!
//! Preview lets an operator watch any individual source, the composed program
//! canvas, or any real encoded output — and it is paid for **only while someone
//! is watching**. It NEVER inserts itself on the protected output path
//! (invariant #10): every tap reads frames that already exist via the engine's
//! lock-free, drop-oldest broadcast channels, so a slow, stalled, or absent
//! preview consumer can never back-pressure the decode / composite / encode /
//! mux path. See [`docs/research/preview-subsystem.md`] and ADR-P001..P005.
//!

//!
//! ## What this crate provides (pure-Rust default build)
//!
//! * [`TapRegistry`] — a registry of preview taps with subscriber **refcounting**,
//!   **lazy-start** on the first subscriber, and **auto-stop** on the last leave.
//!   At most one tap per entity, fanned out to many viewers; cost is ~zero when
//!   nobody is watching. Each [`TapLease`] subscribes to the engine's drop-oldest
//!   broadcast and therefore cannot stall the engine.
//! * [`TokenIssuer`] — short-lived **HMAC-SHA256 signed access tokens** scoped to
//!   exactly one [`TapKey`] + [`AccessScope`], with an absolute expiry. Forged,
//!   tampered, expired, or wrong-tap tokens are rejected; the MAC is verified in
//!   constant time.
//! * [`MjpegStream`] / [`Snapshot`] / [`ThumbnailPlan`] — the `multipart/
//!   x-mixed-replace` MJPEG framing model, the single-JPEG snapshot model (with a
//!   content-derived `ETag`), and the clamped fps/dimension caps that keep preview
//!   cheap. [`JpegEncoder`] is the NV12→JPEG seam; the production default
//!   [`Nv12JpegEncoder`] is a real pure-Rust encoder (NV12 → packed `YCbCr` →
//!   baseline JPEG via the dependency-free `jpeg-encoder` crate), with a
//!   [`StubJpegEncoder`] kept for codec-free framing/refcount tests.
//! * [`FocusGate`] — a hard, deterministic cap on concurrent WHEP **focus**
//!   sessions (a server-wide cap + an independent per-scope cap, conservative
//!   defaults, config-driven). A focus that cannot be admitted is *rejected* so
//!   the operator sheds to the always-available JPEG transport — never queued,
//!   never able to back-pressure the engine (invariant #10). [`FocusLease`]'s
//!   `Drop` frees the slot, mirroring [`TapLease`].
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//!
//! * `webrtc` (off by default) — gates the `whep` WHEP/WebRTC *focus* surface:
//!   the SDP offer/answer + preview-encoder-selection logic, **plus** the
//!   [`whep::transport`] seam — the [`whep::transport::WhepTransport`] trait, the
//!   session lifecycle state machine, the transport-supplied SDP answer
//!   attributes, and the bounded **drop-oldest** [`whep::transport::SampleFeed`]
//!   the preview encoder pushes through (invariant #10) — **and** the
//!   [`whep::program`] PROGRAM-output focus path: the conditional
//!   [`whep::program::ProgramTap`] (no downscale blit until the first subscriber,
//!   ADR-P003), the [`whep::program::PreviewEncoder`] NV12 → sample seam, the
//!   [`whep::program::ProgramFocusSource`] tap→encode→feed wiring, and the
//!   [`whep::program::ProgramFocusSession`] lifecycle (always labeled
//!   [`whep::program::FidelityLabel::PreEncodeCanvasApprox`] per ADR-P005). The
//!   seam is socket-free and pulls **no** native dependency, so this feature build
//!   stays pure Rust; the real GPU downscale blit + low-latency H.264 encode still
//!   land behind a *further* gate (they need a GPU). The default build is the
//!   MJPEG/snapshot model plus signed tokens, with no native or GPU dependency.
//! * `webrtc-native` (off by default; implies `webrtc`) — the **native str0m**
//!   ICE/DTLS/SRTP implementation of the [`whep::transport::WhepTransport`] seam,
//!   in [`whep::native`]. It pulls the `str0m` sans-IO WebRTC stack (and a small
//!   `aws-lc-rs` C/assembly crypto blob), so it is NOT part of the pure-Rust CI
//!   default. Because str0m is sans-IO, the SDP offer→answer negotiation (real
//!   ICE credentials + a real self-signed DTLS-certificate fingerprint) is still
//!   socket-free and unit-tested in CI; only the live DTLS-SRTP handshake + RTP
//!   egress need a real socket/peer and run under an env-gated `#[ignore]`d
//!   loopback test.
