//! The live **mDNS announce + browse** service (ADR-0051 §2, brief §9.1) — the
//! `mdns` feature only.
//!
//! Wraps the maintained, deny-clean [`mdns_sd`] daemon (RFC 6762/6763) as a
//! [`MeshTransport`]: it **announces** this machine's signed
//! [`AnnouncePayload`](crate::announce::AnnouncePayload) as a Conspect service
//! type and **browses** for neighbours, draining their announcements for the
//! pure logic to decode + fold into the [`PeerTable`](crate::peer::PeerTable).
//!
//! ## IPv6-first (ADR-0042, hard rule)
//!
//! mDNS is link-local multicast on `ff02::fb` (IPv6 primary) with IPv4
//! `224.0.0.251` as legacy interop — `mdns_sd` joins both groups on every
//! multicast-capable interface, IPv6 included, so the announce is IPv6-first by
//! construction. The service binds dual-stack via the daemon's per-interface
//! join; there is no IPv4-only path.
//!
//! ## Isolation — best-effort, never blocks (invariant #10)
//!
//! Every operation is best-effort: a daemon error is a typed
//! [`MeshError::Transport`] the caller logs and carries on from. [`poll_received`]
//! is **non-blocking** (it drains the browse channel with `try_recv`, never
//! `recv`), so a poll that finds nothing returns immediately and the announce
//! task never blocks on the network. The service holds no engine handle.
//!
//! ## TXT chunking
//!
//! The signed payload (JSON, all-ASCII) can exceed a single 255-byte mDNS TXT
//! string, so it is split into byte-chunks across numbered properties
//! (`c` = chunk count, `p0`, `p1`, …) and reassembled on receipt. The publish
//! side (`chunk_txt`) enforces a TOTAL contract before it emits anything: it
//! refuses more than `MAX_CHUNKS` chunks with a typed
//! [`MeshError::AnnounceTooLarge`], and refuses any chunk that is not valid UTF-8
//! with [`MeshError::AnnounceNotText`] rather than skip it. Either fault would
//! otherwise emit an announce every peer's receive-side reassembly bound silently
//! drops (an over-cap `c`, or a `c` count larger than the `p{index}` properties
//! present), so it is failed observably at the source. Today's payload is
//! pure-ASCII JSON (integer/hex arrays, kebab-case enums, RFC3339 instants — no
//! free-form string field), so neither fault fires in practice; the guards are
//! defence in depth against future payload growth.
