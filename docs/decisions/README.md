# Architecture Decision Records

These ADRs capture the load-bearing decisions for the Multiview engine. 154 ADRs total. Most are **Proposed** — derived from the design briefs in [../research](../research/). The [Implementation Build-out](#implementation-build-out) series (`ADR-I*`) records decisions **Accepted** during the foundation build-out (the as-built state, which may deliberately and temporarily diverge from a Proposed ADR or from [conventions](../architecture/conventions.md) with a tracked follow-up).

## Core Engine

- [ADR-0001](ADR-0001.md) — Hybrid media engine: FFmpeg/libav for demux/decode/encode + custom Rust for compositing and serving
- [ADR-0002](ADR-0002.md) — rsmpeg as the primary libav binding
- [ADR-0003](ADR-0003.md) — Per-stage HAL with runtime auto-negotiation and zero-copy-island preference
- [ADR-0004](ADR-0004.md) — Zero-copy islands per vendor; explicit copy at every cross-vendor/NDI/CPU boundary
- [ADR-0005](ADR-0005.md) — Custom GPU-native compositor (CUDA / Metal / Vulkan·wgpu·libplacebo), not FFmpeg filters
- [ADR-0006](ADR-0006.md) — RTSP serving via in-process gst-rtsp-server, with MediaMTX as optional sidecar
- [ADR-0007](ADR-0007.md) — CMAF-first HLS with custom-built Apple LL-HLS
- [ADR-0008](ADR-0008.md) — NDI first-class but feature-gated, dynamically loaded, with attribution
- [ADR-0009](ADR-0009.md) — Hybrid concurrency: dedicated-thread data plane + Tokio control/IO plane
- [ADR-0010](ADR-0010.md) — Declarative layered config: TOML/JSON + serde adjacently-tagged enums + JSON Schema
- [ADR-0011](ADR-0011.md) — Cross-platform targets: Linux containers (NVIDIA + VAAPI) and macOS native universal2
- [ADR-0012](ADR-0012.md) — LGPL-clean default build; GPL/nonfree/NDI strictly opt-in; project dual MIT OR Apache-2.0
- [ADR-0013](ADR-0013.md) — Deadline-driven compositor with per-tile FrameSync and continuous drift correction
- [ADR-0014](ADR-0014.md) — Encode the multiview once per output; size density to physical NVENC chips
- [ADR-0015](ADR-0015.md) — YouTube live ingest via an external runtime-discovered resolver (yt-dlp) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0016](ADR-0016.md) — Efficient overlay rendering: GPU glyph-atlas text + libass subtitles + cached/dirty-region compositing *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0019](ADR-0019.md) — Native multi-form caption ingest: unified cue model decoded in-demux into a per-tile sampled cue store *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0024](ADR-0024.md) — Native caption master-fetch over libav avio (no `curl`, no HTTP dep) + bounded retry; fetcher seam for offline tests *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-0044](ADR-0044.md) — Local display output via DRM/KMS: the off-by-default `display-kms` raw-frame sink (drm-rs + gbm), mailbox flip policy, scanout affinity *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0045](ADR-0045.md) — Display-node mode: `multiview node` subcommand, enrollment/pairing, node presentation discipline, display-locked clock option *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0048](ADR-0048.md) — WebRTC transport endpoint: new leaf crate `multiview-webrtc` (feature `native`, str0m =0.16.2 pinned) owning ALL native WebRTC transport (relocated from `multiview-preview`'s `webrtc-native`) — ONE dual-stack `[::]` UDP socket (default 8189) muxing every session (WHIP ingest · WHEP preview · WHEP output viewers · WHIP push) by ICE-ufrag/learned-addr, full-ICE (never ice-lite) with IPv6-first host candidates + `webrtc.advertised_addresses`, per-run self-signed DTLS cert, one bounded driver task the engine never awaits (inv #10), session GC + `max_sessions` *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0049](ADR-0049.md) — WebRTC program outputs: `Output::Webrtc` (WHEP serve of the REAL H.264 program rendition to ≤`max_viewers` — fanout `PacketSink` route()+1, encode-once inv #7, B-frames-off validated at config time, SPS/PPS prepend at IDR, rate-limited force-IDR seam) + `Output::WhipPush` (RFC 9725 client publish: Bearer, 307-redirect-follow, supervised reconnect like RTMP/SRT push) + ONE program Opus rendition embedded for all WebRTC consumers; engine-protected real outputs, never shed by the preview ladder, bounded per-viewer drop-oldest rings *(Proposed)*

## Account / Conspect (account-side subsystem)

The **account-side** subsystem — entitlement/licensing, local mesh, two-pipe heartbeat/telemetry, and support — that **never touches the protected output core** (inv #1). Backed by [conspect-account-architecture](../research/conspect-account-architecture.md); `CONSPECT-*` backlog in [work-schedule](../development/work-schedule.md).

- [ADR-0050](ADR-0050.md) — Conspect entitlement: NEW leaf crate `multiview-licence` (depends only on `core`+`events`; `heartbeat` feature-gated, state model always compiled) owning the entitlement/lease/claim/transfer state machines + the **enforcement-ladder-AS-DATA** (`enforcement.level` on the licence resource: `active`/`warning`/`config-locked`/`watermark`/`block-new-instance`/`unlicensed-build`) + salted-digest fingerprint **score** (`FINGERPRINT_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 70`/`STRONG = 100`). EXACT lease constants (`LEASE_FULL`=35d, `LEASE_GRACE`=14d, `LEASE_HARD`=90d, `ACTIVATION_WINDOW`=31d; claim `CLAIM_CODE_TTL`=15m/`CLAIM_REJECT_WINDOW`=24h/6-char ambiguity-free code; `TRANSFER_WINDOW`=72h). **Never-off-air** (inv #1/#10): the engine reads exactly TWO pre-derived atomics on the hot loop (config-lock S2 + watermark S3) + a startup gate S1 — `block-new-instance` blocks a NEW instance, the **running program stays on air on every rung**; enforcement fails toward leniency. **Honest source-build caveat**: heartbeat can be compiled out → `unlicensed-build` reported honestly, licence binds regardless, official binaries are the licensed convenience. Ed25519 signing *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0051](ADR-0051.md) — Conspect mesh: NEW leaf crate `multiview-mesh` (depends `licence`+`core`+`events`; `mdns` feature-gated) — **always-on** IPv6-first mDNS (`ff02::fb`, IPv4 `224.0.0.251` legacy) announce/browse of **Ed25519-signed** salted-digest summaries (never raw identity); discovered peers enter an **untrusted inventory** with explicit operator **confirm-adopt** (the ADR-0041 doctrine); **end-to-end-signed relay** so an offline machine heartbeats via an online LAN neighbour that is a **dumb carrier** (cannot read/forge/alter the assertion — relay integrity never depends on trusting the relayer); opt-in per machine, bounded drop-oldest, off-hot-loop control-plane actor (inv #10) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0052](ADR-0052.md) — Conspect two-pipe model: **mandatory monthly licensing heartbeat** vs **opt-in daily product telemetry** — NEVER co-mingled (separate transport/consent/copy/API/retention; the UI must never present them as one switch). Telemetry consent is a versioned single-value doc resolved **last-writer-wins** by `updated_at`; the heartbeat consent is implicit in running the official build (not in the doc). **Consent-independent** local metrics retention (engine seam S5): turning telemetry OFF stops the outbound daily pipe but NOT the bounded auto-pruned local buffer that feeds the operator's own support context-pack. Data-minimisation: salted digests + aggregated/anonymised counters only, never raw serials/MACs/media/URLs. Extends `multiview-telemetry` (additive, off-hot-loop, inv #10) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0053](ADR-0053.md) — Conspect support: ticketing + **redacted** context-pack (local metrics buffer + licence/enforcement state + config-as-code with **reference-only secrets** per ADR-M006 — diagnostics only, never media/raw-identifiers/secret-values) + **data-request local approval** (no data egress without an explicit operator approval — surfaced as a pending action) + **append-only** account audit (claim/transfer/lease/enforcement/consent/context-pack/data-request — no update/delete route, immutable timestamped entries; in-memory default, sqlite under the `sqlite` feature per ADR-I003). Extends `multiview-control` (additive routes/stores, off-hot-loop, inv #10) *(Proposed)*

## Resilience & A/V

- [ADR-R001](ADR-R001.md) — Continuous-output guarantee via inverted control flow, output clock, and per-tile last-good-frame stores
- [ADR-R002](ADR-R002.md) — Three-tier fault isolation: process-isolate FFI ingest and encoder; protect the output core
- [ADR-R003](ADR-R003.md) — Supervision, backoff, circuit breakers, watchdogs, and bounded memory
- [ADR-R004](ADR-R004.md) — Pin output session params; seamless edits via atomic scene-graph swap; Class-2 changes via parallel-output migration
- [ADR-R005](ADR-R005.md) — Discrete per-input audio routing + program bus, with a verified per-output capability matrix and explicit degradation
- [ADR-R006](ADR-R006.md) — In-process EBU R128 metering, read-only and non-blocking, two cadences, true-peak gated
- [ADR-R007](ADR-R007.md) — Subtitle ingest -> libass burn-in (off hot path) + format-aware discrete passthrough
- [ADR-R008](ADR-R008.md) — Overlay rendering: serializable layer stack, glyphon/Vello+SDF, premultiplied alpha, dirty-region uploads, input-decoupled
- [ADR-R009](ADR-R009.md) — Resilience testing: always-on output-validity probe as SLO arbiter, layered chaos, soak/fuzz, GPU-less CI
- [ADR-R010](ADR-R010.md) — Make-before-break parallel-output migration primitive: the implementable five-phase Class-2 cutover contract (validate→spin-up→warm→swap→drain/stop) shared by CTL-6 (config migration) and GPU-5c (re-placement); preserves inv #1/#10 via two independent output clocks + non-blocking `move_sink` cutover + an off-data-plane coordinator *(Proposed)*

## Efficiency

- [ADR-E002](ADR-E002.md) — NV12-throughout pixel-format policy; YUV->RGB only in-shader
- [ADR-E003](ADR-E003.md) — Composite once, encode the canvas once per rendition
- [ADR-E004](ADR-E004.md) — Encode-once, mux-many fan-out (tee semantics); ladder is a separate cost
- [ADR-E005](ADR-E005.md) — Reference-counted frame pool with bounded, drop-oldest working set
- [ADR-E006](ADR-E006.md) — Adaptive dirty-region recompositing & frame-rate harmonization (opt-in)
- [ADR-E007](ADR-E007.md) — Resource-adaptive degradation & admission control without breaking output
- [ADR-E008](ADR-E008.md) — Cost-model-driven planner with a capability+cost registry
- [ADR-E009](ADR-E009.md) — Per-tier efficiency budgets enforced by perf-regression CI
- [ADR-0017](ADR-0017.md) — GPU/CPU utilisation monitoring + affinity-aware least-loaded multi-GPU work placement *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0018](ADR-0018.md) — Adaptive affinity-first GPU work-placement with deliberate split + closed-loop re-placement *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0022](ADR-0022.md) — Real-time software compositor: parallelize + LUT the per-pixel colour pipeline; content-aware smoothness gate *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-0023](ADR-0023.md) — Region-limited overlay bake: per-primitive dirty rects + exact passthrough, end the full-canvas colour round-trip (inv #5) *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-0025](ADR-0025.md) — Streaming encode: bound memory + continuous output on run-until (off-hot-path bake consumer + bounded queue, offline-block/live-drop) *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-0026](ADR-0026.md) — Encode-once-mux-many: hoist the single encoder into the bake consumer, fan encoded packets to mux-only sinks (folds in bounded teardown) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0027](ADR-0027.md) — Synthetic sources are first-class: bars/solid/clock as in-process `SourceKind`s through the one uniform ingest path (`test` kept as a `bars` alias) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0047](ADR-0047.md) — Clock & timer synthetic sources (extends ADR-0027): a **dual** analogue+digital `Clock` face + per-clock metadata (IANA `timezone`, `label`, `show_offset` badge, optional `show_reference`/`numerals`); a new countdown/countup `SourceKind::Timer` (target `time_of_day`|`datetime`, `direction`, `on_target` hold/continue/zero_then_up/recur, `format`, overrun styling); IANA→concrete-offset resolved per displayed instant (DST-correct) via **`chrono-tz`** (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`, bundled public-domain tzdb — deny-clean, default build); all reuse the as-built `clock_face` SDF primitives + `TextEngine` runs + NV12/linear bake (no new renderer), integer/`chrono` time only (inv #3/#6), wall-clock SAMPLED not pacing (inv #1), reference display-only (ADR-T012); additive (`schema_version` unchanged); SYN-CLOCK-*/SYN-TIMER-* backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0028](ADR-0028.md) — Native NDI FFI binding data design: resolve-once flat `NdiV6` fn-pointer table, RAII safe handles, all `unsafe` confined to `multiview-ndi-sys` *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-0029](ADR-0029.md) — ACME/TLS for the control plane: DNS-01 only, rustls (no openssl), pluggable `DnsProvider` trait with Cloudflare first, fail-soft renewal off the engine path (inv #10) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0030](ADR-0030.md) — Multiple active programs: a `Program` actor (multiview/passthrough/transcode) under a `ProgramSet` supervisor with per-program output clocks + shared time source, decode-once-use-many source registry, admission control + per-program degradation *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0031](ADR-0031.md) — Build our own pinned FFmpeg (reject jellyfin/PPA): LGPL-clean `--disable-everything` allowlist + separated GPL variant, reproducible multi-arch builder, FFmpeg 7.1.4 first (binding pin) then gated 8.1.1; shrink FFmpeg to codec+hwaccel only *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0032](ADR-0032.md) — HLS/LL-HLS delivery: tier the serving boundary (static-frontable master/segments/init for any CDN vs Multiview's own async blocking-reload origin for the live LL-HLS playlist + byte-range parts); CMAF/fMP4 default container; rolling-playlist + DVR + atomic-publish + deferred-unlink-pruning foundation; configurable locations/`base_url`; Cache-Control/CORS header contract + reference nginx/traefik config; HLS-0..14 backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0033](ADR-0033.md) — AES67 / ST 2110-30 audio I/O (open-interop-first, no proprietary SDK): L16/L24 PCM-over-RTP send+receive; PTP/ST 2059-2 media-clock as a REFERENCE not a pacer (slave the audio sample clock, keep the video output clock free-running, inv #1) + boundary resampler; SDP+SAP discovery, NMOS IS-04/05 optional; receive reuses the existing st2110 depacketizer; bounded fail-honest on loss; AES67-0..N backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0034](ADR-0034.md) — Per-stream decoupled routing + instant crosspoint switching: inputs/layouts/outputs as independent resources wired by per-stream crosspoints (video→cell, audio-track→bus w/ BREAKAWAY, subtitle→layer, SCTE-35/timecode→output) over the ADR-0030 ProgramSet+SourceRegistry; StreamInventory discovery; instant warm re-point (Class-1) reusing GP-6/GP-7 restamp+splice + ADR-R004 make-before-break (Class-2); honest #11 classifier inspecting destination pinned params (incl. Reset-lite tier); atomic mixed-stream salvo; RT-0..17 backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0035](ADR-0035.md) — Self-aware placement + capability detection + actionable health warnings: probe usable backends (wgpu adapter / NVDEC / NVENC) + cross-check vs NVML hardware → detect+warn the silent CPU-fallback (the RTX-4060-idle-while-5-cores-burn bug); wire the already-built cost-model/select_device/PlacementController/degradation engine into the run (sense→plan→apply) net of co-tenant load, affinity-preserving (never fragment a pipeline); SA-0..N backlog, SA-0 = detect+warn the compositor mismatch *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0036](ADR-0036.md) — Validated codec catalog: typed codecs (building on the existing multiview-ffmpeg VideoCodec/AudioCodec enums) constrained by a TRANSPORT×codec matrix AND a CODEC×ACCELERATION matrix; explicit per-host class CPU-only/GPU-only/BOTH/dedicated(future) from the ADR-0035 throwaway-open probe (e.g. AV1 NVENC needs Ada+; H264 CPU encode needs gpl-codecs); config codec becomes a constrained enum validated against transport∩hardware (no silent mpeg2 fallback); /capabilities/codecs API + UI dropdown w/ accel+license badges; CODEC-0..N backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0037](ADR-0037.md) — ISO (isolated per-source) + Program (composited-output) recording: faithful all-stream copy-remux tapping Demuxer::read_packet before video-selection; segmented + time/size retention (reuse the HLS rolling-window + atomic publish); disk-pressure threshold disarm; bulletproof bounded drop-oldest + capped-backoff write path that can NEVER back-pressure/stall the engine (inv #1/#10); preserves original source timestamps (archive as-is); reuses GP-7 copy path, RT-12 fan-out sink-mover, GP-6 restamp, ADR-0035 health warnings; REC-0..N backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0038](ADR-0038.md) — Per-source wall-clock trust + multi-source time-of-day sync: detect a source wall-clock + classify Trusted/Suspected/None (reuse the PTP/NTP lock-state machine), operator Use/Discard, reclock-to-house on discard (the as-built normalize.rs anchor); extract RTCP-SR/HLS-PDT/TEMI/SMPTE-timecode-SEI; per-program ENCODED-pre-decode alignment buffer (decoder runs D-behind, framestore stays bounded — ~6MB vs ~3.1GB/4K-source) with MAX-window→OFFLINE (never stall); output cadence house-locked but the wall-clock LABEL = the synced instant T=now−D; reclocked sources house-align by arrival only (never content-sync); SYNC-0..N backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0039](ADR-0039.md) — SRT (Secure Reliable Transport — the network transport, **not** subtitles) input + output via a **tiered transport seam**: Tier-0 keep FFmpeg `srt://` as the license-clean (libsrt MPL-2.0, already `--enable-libsrt`, no GPL) caller-mode baseline + conformance oracle, and wire the **orphaned** typed `SrtConfig` (`multiview-input/src/srt.rs`) into the schema backward-compatibly (optional `SrtOptions`, no version bump) — fixing the two verified defects (passphrase `10..=79`→`10..=80`; latency ms→µs `×1000`); Tier-1 own the two things FFmpeg structurally **cannot** (verified: `libavformat` never calls `srt_bstats`/`srt_bistats`; its listener is single-connection) behind a socket-free `SrtTransport` seam over pure-Rust srt-tokio — link statistics→telemetry/`HealthWarning` (ADR-0035) + listener-mode stream-id Access-Control multiplexing (ADR-0034 routing); TSBPD is an INPUT jitter buffer, never the output clock (inv #1/#2), and stats/accept/egress paths are drop-oldest, never back-pressuring the engine (inv #10); Tier-2 **defer** an owned `multiview-srt-sys` libsrt FFI leaf for bonding (ADR-0028 pattern, only-if-required); SRT-0..12 backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0040](ADR-0040.md) — IP multicast transport (UDP-TS + RTP, the broadcast contribution/distribution norm) input + output: typed `SourceKind::Udp`/`Rtp` + `Output::Udp`/`Rtp` with structured group/port/`sources`(SSM)/`interface`/`ttl`/buffer fields (mirroring the implemented `RtspOptions` precedent — **not** a raw URL), libav `udp`/`rtp` URL **derived** from typed config (SSM/interface/buffer defaults baked); wires the already-built-but-unreachable `PushProtocol::UdpTs` + a new `::Rtp`; scoped to **compressed** TS-over-UDP/RTP (MP2T PT33) — uncompressed ST 2110-20 out of scope, reusing only the `st2110` RTP-parse/seq/2022-7/bounded-channel prior art; receive socket is an INPUT jitter buffer never a pacer (inv #1/#2), bounded drop-oldest both ways (inv #10), encode-once-mux-many egress (inv #7). Plus a **bulletproof, false-positive-free container-without-host-networking HealthWarning** (the silent-bridge-multicast trap, ADR-0035 sense→detect→warn): a conjunctive advisory startup heuristic (`container-no-host-networking`) + an authoritative runtime confirmation (`multicast-joined-no-traffic`), never auto-fails. The media foundation SAP (ADR-0041) + AES67/ST2110 sit on; MC-0..12 backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0041](ADR-0041.md) — SAP (Session Announcement Protocol, RFC 2974 — VLC "Network Streams (SAP)", **not** subtitles) discovery + announcement, sitting on the ADR-0040 multicast transport: build **one** essence-agnostic SAP packet engine (`multiview-input/src/sap/`) + **one** general RFC 8866 SDP model (`multiview-input/src/sdp/`) covering video/audio/MP2T, and collapse the planned AES67 SAP/SDP (AES67-5/-6) into thin profiles — **supersedes ADR-0033 §6/§9's audio-only placement**, no second SAP. RECEIVE → a bounded, **untrusted** discovered-session inventory the operator **confirm-binds** to a Source (Class-1, never auto-ingest); ANNOUNCE → a tokio-timer emits SDP for our multicast outputs (≥30s, scope-selected group) so VLC/Dante discover them (ships with the MC-4 egress). Verified wire details (3-bit version, `auth_len`×4-not-VLC's-bug, ±1/3 jitter, `max(10×period,1h)` purge, reject `E`/inbound-`T=1`, full group set incl. de-facto `239.255.255.255`); listener/announcer/publish all off the data plane, bounded drop-oldest (inv #1/#10). SAP-0..10 backlog *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-0042](ADR-0042.md) — **IPv6-first** networking; IPv4 is **legacy-only and on a deprecation path** (the operator directive — all products are IPv6-first). The principle was undocumented, so IPv4-only assumptions accreted (audit: `nmos/is05` SDP parser silently mangles `c=IN IP6`; WHEP answers hardcode `IN IP4`; telemetry/SNMP bind `0.0.0.0`; ST2110 has only `join_multicast_v4`; control `listen` + example-streams IPv4-only; ADR-0040/0041 led IPv4). DECISION: bind **dual-stack `[::]`** (`IPV6_V6ONLY=false`) not `0.0.0.0` (loopback `[::1]`); bracket IPv6 URL literals; SDP `c=IN IP6` first-class (**no TTL** — scope in the address, RFC 8866 §5.7); IPv6 multicast `ff00::/8` + SSM `FF3x::/32` via **MLDv2** primary (IPv4 `239/8`/`232/8`+IGMPv3 legacy); examples lead IPv6. Dual-stack defaults keep legacy IPv4 working through the deprecation window (IPv6-**first**, not IPv6-only yet). Re-points ADR-0040/0041 IPv6-first; canonical in [conventions §10](../architecture/conventions.md); IPV6-0..9 remediation backlog. No data-plane invariant moves. *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-0043](ADR-0043.md) — Relicense Multiview from `MIT OR Apache-2.0` to a **source-available, non-commercial** license (dual-license): adopt the Multiview Source-Available Non-Commercial License (root [`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE)) + a separate Commercial License ([`LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md`](../../LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md)) before the first public tag; free for genuine personal/home/non-commercial use + three exceptions (First Nations Owned Broadcasters; Community Broadcasters < USD $1M sponsorship/yr; Content Creators < 55,000 aggregate subscribers), paid Commercial License for everyone else; require a CLA (inbound = outbound **plus** relicense/commercial right); stop calling Multiview "open source"/"free software" (use **source-available**); keep the **dependency** posture unchanged (FFmpeg LGPL, `gpl-codecs` GPL opt-in, NDI proprietary runtime-loaded) and keep encumbered builds out of the public channel (encumbered-artifact CI split to follow); supersedes [ADR-0012](ADR-0012.md) *(Accepted)*

## Color

- [ADR-C001](ADR-C001.md) — Canvas working & output color space defaults to SDR BT.709 limited, with opt-in HDR canvas
- [ADR-C002](ADR-C002.md) — Untagged-input default policy: resolution heuristic for matrix/primaries, format class for range, never auto-HDR
- [ADR-C003](ADR-C003.md) — Composite in linear light with premultiplied alpha
- [ADR-C004](ADR-C004.md) — Range handled explicitly in-shader exactly once; expand on input, compress on output
- [ADR-C005](ADR-C005.md) — HDR->SDR tone-mapping default: per-tile BT.2390 EETF anchored at 203-nit reference white
- [ADR-C006](ADR-C006.md) — Always explicitly tag output across encoder + container/protocol, then verify with ffprobe

## Streaming/Timing

- [ADR-T001](ADR-T001.md) — Single internal monotonic timeline + fixed-cadence output clock drives the compositor
- [ADR-T002](ADR-T002.md) — Per-tile frame resampling = hold-last-good + duplicate/drop (sample on output tick)
- [ADR-T003](ADR-T003.md) — Per-input timestamp normalization: unwrap, genpts fallback, monotonic guard, discontinuity re-anchor
- [ADR-T004](ADR-T004.md) — HLS ingest pacing: custom PTS-to-wall-clock pacer, not -re
- [ADR-T005](ADR-T005.md) — HLS/LL-HLS output: wall-clock-paced, GOP-aligned segments; custom origin for true LL-HLS
- [ADR-T006](ADR-T006.md) — Long-run clock drift: monotonic master + PI/dead-band loop + adaptive audio resampling
- [ADR-T007](ADR-T007.md) — Codec edge-case & decode/encode policy: one bad input never stalls the multiview
- [ADR-T008](ADR-T008.md) — A/V sync & per-input jitter-buffer model
- [ADR-T009](ADR-T009.md) — Per-tile media-time ring uses O(capacity) copy-on-write publish, not an in-place O(1) ring
- [ADR-T010](ADR-T010.md) — Dante audio via AES67 / ST 2110-30 (open); native Dante is licence-gated *(Accepted)*
- [ADR-T011](ADR-T011.md) — HLS rendition isolation: pin the main demuxer to a video variant playlist (FFmpeg-8.x-robust); the isolated WebVTT reader is the sole WebVTT path
- [ADR-T012](ADR-T012.md) — Reference-clock / wall-clock source-selection contract: free-run vs PTP-grandmaster (ST 2059-2 profile/domain) vs NTP-disciplined precedence, the Holdover→RefLoss failover ladder + `AlarmKind::ReferenceLoss`, and the disciplined reference as a MEDIA-CLOCK REFERENCE only — never a pacer (inv #1; gates AES67-5 + M12)
- [ADR-T013](ADR-T013.md) — The shared RTP-audio → AudioStore program-clock rebase seam (WebRTC Opus + AES67 + future converge on one path) *(Proposed)*
- [ADR-T014](ADR-T014.md) — WHIP ingest (RFC 9725): `SourceKind::Webrtc` published at `POST /api/v1/whip/{source_id}` (per-source Bearer token, single-publisher 409, PATCH→405 vanilla ICE, RFC 9457 errors) over a native-free `WhipProvider` seam; RTP-mode session → `MediaEngine` → keyframe-gated H.264 depacketizer → packet-fed decoder → `TileStore` (`WrapBits::Rtp32`, decode-at-display-res inv #6) + Opus de-embed → `AudioStore` → program-bus routing; event-driven PLI — session start/loss, ≥2 s rate-limited (documented OBS publish profile); unpublished = NO_SIGNAL, tile rides the normal state machine; add/remove/edit classified like the other network sources *(Proposed)*

- [ADR-G004](ADR-G004.md) — Scope discipline, no-silent-suppression, secrets, and supply-chain guardrails for agents
- [ADR-0046](ADR-0046.md) — Skip the heavy CI matrix on **prose-docs-only** PRs via a fail-safe `dorny/paths-filter` `changes` job: `code = '**'` minus a strict prose allowlist under `predicate-quantifier: every`, so any non-prose file (incl. `docs/api/**` specs, lockfiles, configs, new extensions) keeps `code=true` → full matrix; only `.md`/`.txt`/images/`LICENSE*`/`NOTICE` outside `docs/api/**` can skip. Heavy jobs gate on `code=='true'` (and only on `pull_request`; pushes to `main` always run full); `inclusive-language` + a new dependency-free `docs-sanity` link check always run so docs PRs still get a green signal (and stay required-check-safe if branch protection is added). No code/config/spec/web PR loses any check — only *when* the unchanged jobs run changes *(Accepted)*

## Implementation Build-out

Decisions **Accepted** during the foundation build-out — the as-built state of the engine, compositor, control plane, and broadcast-feature placement (some deliberately and temporarily diverge from a Proposed ADR or from conventions, with a tracked follow-up noted in the ADR).

- [ADR-I001](ADR-I001.md) — Engine isolation primitives: `arc_swap::ArcSwapOption` (wait-free latest-state) + `tokio::sync::broadcast` (drop-oldest events), replacing a hand-rolled Mutex ring (realizes invariant #10)
- [ADR-I002](ADR-I002.md) — GPU compositor: wgpu behind an off-by-default `wgpu` feature; WGSL shaders are naga-validated GPU-free and SSIM≥0.98/PSNR≥40 dB-gated at runtime (follow-up: flip `wgpu` to default per conventions §3)
- [ADR-I003](ADR-I003.md) — Control persistence: SQLite/sqlx behind an off-by-default `sqlite` feature; in-memory trait `Repository` is the tested default; scoped cargo-deny ignore of RUSTSEC-2024-0436
- [ADR-I004](ADR-I004.md) — Broadcast multiviewer (M10–M12) feature placement: modules inside the existing 16 crates (no new crates), native/hardware behind off-by-default features
- [ADR-I005](ADR-I005.md) — One packet carrier (RT-12): converge the two live `EncodedPacket` types on `multiview_ffmpeg::EncodedPacket` (the `AVPacket` wrapper, `StreamKind`-tagged) as the single fan-out carrier. BOTH types are production today — the libav-muxed family (file/HLS/TS/RTMP/SRT) carries the `AVPacket` wrapper, and the GStreamer RTSP egress (`RtspServerSink` + bounded queue) carries `fanout::EncodedPacket`'s `Arc<[u8]>` and serves NALs DIRECTLY (no libav muxer). Convergence keeps the byte-payload shape the RTSP/NDI egress needs via a documented `payload()->&[u8]` seam (zero-copy), folds `PacketKind` → `StreamKind` + keyframe flag, and keeps `PacketRouter`/`EncodeOnceDriver` as the GPU-free encode-once proof harness; AUD-4 / OUT-2 (closing the `pipeline.rs` RTSP wiring gap) / PRV-5 all build against it. RT-13 is the separate egress splicer
